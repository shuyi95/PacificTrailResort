            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>
              The Pacific Trails Resorts has been established for over a decade,
              and we mainly persist to keep the same concept from the beginning
              til now. The establishment of this resort was originally from the
              owner's sake of wishing to have a luxury escape in the nature with
              his family. Therefore, he initially the concept of building all
              sorts of activities his kid would love to do, and while they are
              having fun in the nature, he and his wife could also have a
              relaxing time of their own at any lounge nearby.
